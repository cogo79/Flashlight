Flashlight

This search engine is tested in Chrome. Hopefully it works just as good in other browsers also but I have not tested it in other browsers so far.

To run this webapp. Clone the repo. Then install Node.js(version 4.4.X) and npm.js(version 2.15.X). "cd" in to the Flashlight in the terminal and run "npm install" and then "bower install". After that you can run the app with "npm start". Open a Chrome and navigate to "http://localhost:3030/" and then you can test the search-engine.
